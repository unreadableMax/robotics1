MUSCOD Sample application - Information

Hint: please look into ~/MUSCOD-II/MC2/Src/DOC/MANUAL/uman.pdf for more information.

== 0. Prerequisites ==

Install MUSCOD-II.

Get the MUSCOD_SAMPLE sources. Make sure you have a version compatible to your
MUSCOD sources (e.g. same "tag" or both latest development version from
trunk).

It is assumed you have the source in "~/MUSCOD-II/Apps/MC2_SAMPLE/Src".

== 1. Configure MUSCOD_SAMPLE ==

Create a new directory "~/MUSCOD-II/Apps/MC2_SAMPLE/Debug"
Then cd to this directory and run the CMake GUI

# ccmake ../Src

When you press "c" for the first time to configure, CMake will complain that
MUSCOD_DIR needs to be set. Placate CMake with one of your MUSCOD_* binary directories
(e.g. "~/MUSCOD-II/MC2/Debug").

When you press "c" again, CMake will transfer configuration options form your
MUSCOD installation to the test examples.

Press "g" to generate the makefiles.

== 2. Compile MUSCOD_SAMPLE ==

Type:
# make

== 3. Configure directories ==

For MUSCOD-II to run properly you need the following subdirectories in the
current directory (assuming it is ~/MUSCOD-II/Apps/MC2_SAMPLE/Debug):
  ./DAT/  which contains the sample.dat file (you find this file in the
          ../Src/DAT directory)
	./RES/  into which the results will be stored

== 4. Run examples ==

Try:

# muscod

If this does fail, make sure to adjust your $PATH variable such that the
MUSCOD executable 'muscod' is being found.

Otherwise run

# muscod sample 

Have fun.

== 5. Plot output ==

The file default.plot defines the types of plot that are created (screen,
PostScript, GIF) and it needs to be in the same directory where you call
muscod. Adjust it at your own will to get the desired output.
